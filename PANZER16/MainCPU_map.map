WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   CU/RegisterBankSelectMux/GND_121_o_GND_121_o_OR_269_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   220 out of   2,278    9%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       100 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          739
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           247 out of     739   33%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              70 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
